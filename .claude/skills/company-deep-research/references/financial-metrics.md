# Financial Metrics Reference

## Profitability Metrics

### Gross Margin
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100%
```
**Interpretation:**
- >50%: Strong pricing power (software, luxury)
- 30-50%: Moderate (manufacturing, retail)
- <30%: Commodity-like, volume-dependent

### Operating Margin
```
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue × 100%
```
**Watch for:** Trend direction matters more than absolute level

### ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)
```
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital
NOPAT = Operating Income × (1 - Tax Rate)
Invested Capital = Total Equity + Total Debt - Cash
```
**Benchmark:** 
- >15%: Value creation
- 8-15%: Adequate
- <8%: Below cost of capital (value destruction)

### FCF Conversion
```
FCF Conversion = Free Cash Flow / Net Income × 100%
```
**Red flags:**
- <80% consistently: Earnings quality concern
- >120%: May be under-investing

## Leverage Metrics

### Debt/EBITDA
```
Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
```
**Thresholds:**
- <1x: Conservative
- 1-3x: Moderate
- 3-5x: Leveraged
- >5x: High risk

### Interest Coverage
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```
**Minimum:** 3x for investment grade

### Net Debt/Equity
```
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash
Net Debt/Equity = Net Debt / Shareholders' Equity
```

## Growth Metrics

### Revenue CAGR
```
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1
```
Use 3-year and 5-year for trend analysis

### Same-Store Sales (Retail)
Organic growth excluding new locations

### Bookings vs Revenue (SaaS)
- Bookings: New contract value signed
- Revenue: Recognized per GAAP
- Watch for: Bookings growing faster than revenue = future growth

## Valuation Metrics

### P/E Ratio
```
P/E = Stock Price / EPS
Forward P/E = Stock Price / Next 12M EPS Estimate
```

### EV/EBITDA
```
EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
```
Better than P/E for comparing companies with different capital structures

### PEG Ratio
```
PEG = P/E / EPS Growth Rate
```
- <1: Potentially undervalued
- 1-2: Fair value
- >2: Potentially expensive

### FCF Yield
```
FCF Yield = Free Cash Flow / Market Cap × 100%
```
**Attractive:** >5% for mature companies

## Quality Indicators

### Accrual Ratio
```
Accrual Ratio = (Net Income - CFO) / Total Assets
```
**Warning:** High positive accruals = low earnings quality

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365
```
**Watch for:** Rising DSO faster than revenue growth

### Inventory Turnover
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```
**Higher = better** (faster inventory cycle)

## SaaS-Specific Metrics

### ARR/MRR
- ARR = Annual Recurring Revenue
- MRR = Monthly Recurring Revenue

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
```
NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting ARR
```
**Excellent:** >120%
**Good:** 100-120%
**Concern:** <100%

### CAC Payback
```
CAC Payback = Customer Acquisition Cost / (ARR × Gross Margin)
```
**Target:** <18 months

### LTV/CAC
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
LTV/CAC Ratio
```
**Target:** >3x
